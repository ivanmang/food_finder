# food_finder
A project for Udacity's Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree course
# Overview
It might be a daily struggle for many people to find a restaurant nearby. So, I built an app which shows restaurants within 100m. The nearby restaurants can be displayed via Google map or a list. Users are able to explore different restaurants
